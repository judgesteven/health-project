## What We've Built

This React Native app demonstrates a complete health gamification system with the following features:

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Components

1. **Profile Card**
   - User avatar and basic info
   - Level and experience system
   - Daily, weekly, and total step counts
   - Progress bar for next level
   - Team affiliation

2. **Missions Card**
   - Horizontal scrollable mission cards
   - Progress tracking with visual progress bars
   - Reward system (XP and coins)
   - Mission completion status
   - Different mission types (steps, distance, calories, time)

3. **Rankings Card**
   - Top 10 leaderboard entries
   - Medal icons for top 3 positions
   - User avatars and scores
   - Current user highlighting
   - Scrollable list

4. **Prizes Card**
   - Horizontal scrollable prize shop
   - Category-based organization
   - Coin-based purchasing system
   - Owned/unavailable status
   - Purchase confirmation dialogs

### ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety with comprehensive interfaces
- **Component Architecture**: Modular, reusable components
- **Mock Data**: Realistic sample data for all features
- **GameLayer Integration**: Ready-to-use API service structure
- **Health Data Service**: Platform-specific health data integration
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized UI with proper spacing

### ðŸ“± User Experience Features

- **Pull-to-refresh**: Refresh data by pulling down
- **Interactive Elements**: Tap handlers for all cards and buttons
- **Visual Feedback**: Progress bars, completion badges, status indicators
- **Alert Dialogs**: User-friendly confirmation and error messages
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Horizontal and vertical scroll views

## How to Test

### Option 1: TypeScript Compilation Check
```bash
npm run type-check
```
âœ… This verifies all our code compiles correctly

### Option 2: Start Metro Bundler
```bash
npm run dev
```
âœ… This starts the development server (requires device/emulator)

### Option 3: Run on Device (when environment is set up)
```bash
# For iOS (requires Xcode and iOS Simulator)
npm run ios

# For Android (requires Android Studio and emulator)
npm run android
```

## Mock Data Features

The app includes comprehensive mock data:

- **User Profile**: Alex Johnson, Level 12, 125K total steps
- **Missions**: 3 different missions with varying progress
- **Leaderboard**: Top performers with realistic step counts
- **Prizes**: 4 different prize categories with coin costs
- **Achievements**: Unlocked and locked achievements

## GameLayer API Integration

The app is structured to integrate with GameLayer's API:

- **API Configuration**: Pre-configured with your API key and account
- **Player Management**: Create and update player profiles
- **Mission System**: Fetch and track missions
- **Leaderboards**: Real-time ranking data
- **Prize System**: Purchase and manage rewards

## Health Data Integration

Ready for real health data:

- **iOS HealthKit**: Step count, distance, calories
- **Android Google Fit**: Fitness tracking integration
- **Permission Handling**: Proper permission requests
- **Data Sync**: Automatic sync with GameLayer

## Next Steps

1. **Set up development environment** (Android Studio for Android, Xcode for iOS)
2. **Connect real device or emulator**
3. **Replace mock data with GameLayer API calls**
4. **Implement real health data fetching**
5. **Add push notifications for missions**
6. **Implement team features**

## Code Quality

- âœ… TypeScript compilation passes
- âœ… No linting errors
- âœ… Proper component structure
- âœ… Comprehensive type definitions
- âœ… Error handling
- âœ… Responsive design
- âœ… Accessibility considerations

The app is ready for development and testing once the React Native environment is properly configured!
